# Introduction to Design Engineering
Design engineers are problem solvers who bridge the gap between traditional engineering and design. It's a discipline which draws on knowledge of manufacturing techniques, product development, technical design and rapid prototyping to bring new innovations to themarket. It also focuses on improving existing products and the processes used for making them.

This course aims to develop a range of fundamental design and engineering skills, with a particular emphasis on creativity, computer-aided engineering, optimisation, human factors and design process. You will gain the enterprise skills and industrial experience necessary to launch brand new products to market and translate design engineering into impact.


Design engineers use technical knowledge, mathematical expertise and design skills to create innovative solutions to problems across a range of industries
A Design Engineer is involved in the initial concept, design, development and management of projects in a range of sectors such as construction and the built environment, materials, software, components, machinery and vehicles.
To succeed, Design Engineer needs strong technical knowledge, as well as problem solving, communication, leadership and project management skills.
Depending on their specialist area, design engineers may also be known as CAD engineers, consulting engineers and product design engineers.
Types of design engineering
You can usually specialise in one area of design engineering, such as:
chemical engineering
civil engineering
electrical engineering
electronic engineering
mechanical engineering
product/industrial design engineering
software engineering.
Responsibilities
As a design engineer, you'll be required to:
liaise with clients to identify their requirements
investigate and undertake analysis on how to improve existing projects or components
summarise scientific and engineering principles in an easy to understand manner
write technical reports to summarise findings
cover the concept, specification, tender and development of new projects or components
design the aesthetics, materials and functionality of components
use CAD, CAN and CAM systems to design and visualise projects
undertake model making, prototyping and product testing
identify new systems and processes to drive quality, efficiency and save costs
undertake complex calculations
communicate effectively with the clients, colleagues and contractors involved in a project
lead a team of engineers
plan effectively to ensure projects are delivered on time, to standard and to budget.
What to expect
Design work is typically office based, however you'll go on visits to meet clients. Site and plant visits will also be required (depending on your engineering specialism).
Dress code is professional when based in the office and meeting with clients. If visiting a construction site or production plant, a hard hat, overalls and other personal protective equipment will need to be worn.
Design and consulting work is to client deadlines, so at times you'll be required to work extra hours to meet these.
Work opportunities are available nationwide. If working for international organisations, there may be opportunities to travel.
Females, workers with disabilities and ethnic minorities are under-represented across the engineering industries. Diversity issues are recognised by professional bodies and employers. Many employers are seeking new ways to diversify their workforce.
Skills
As a design engineer, you'll need to have:
subject specific technical knowledge and expertise
commercial awareness of your specialist area of engineering
an eye for detail and a methodical work process
IT and CAD knowledge
analytical and numeracy skills
creative problem-solving ability
the ability to work in a team
effective communication to liaise with team members, clients, contractors and others involved in the design process
leadership and negotiation skills
written communication and the ability to write reports
time management, organisation, and the ability to work to deadlines
a flexible approach to work and the ability to adapt to change
a driven, self-motivated attitude and the ability to use initiative.
Employers
Employers range from blue chip companies to SMEs, in both the private and public sector. Self-employment is possible when you are an experienced design engineer. However, some graduates do work freelance or set up their own business after graduation. This is more common in areas such as product and industrial design engineering.
Employers include:
aerospace and automotive industries
computing and software development
construction and building services
design and engineering consultancies
energy utilities, including nuclear
government agencies, local authorities, hospitals and educational institutions
industrial and domestic product manufacturers and retailers
medical engineering
process industries, including pharmaceuticals, food and cosmetics
oil and gas industries, including petrochemical industries
transport and highways industries
water treatment services.
