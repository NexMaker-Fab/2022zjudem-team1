Iván Alejandro Broche Sánchez
-	Nice to meet you! You can call me Ivan.
We live in a world full of secrets to uncover, rooms behind doorless walls, and design is an awesome tool that allow us to build doors in them to give the world access to new solutions and experiences. I love Design and I’m eager to become a master industrial designer.
-	I’m from Cuba and I majored in Industrial Design, my passion is Digital Design and 3D Design
-	One of my hobbies is to explore new creativity apps in the internet and try to create something awesome combining them as tools. I am very interested in the newest AI solutions and metaverses.
-	I have skills in a wide variety of computer softwares, all the way from most Adobe Suite programs (specially Photoshop and Illustrator), 3D Design and CAD (Autodesk 3dsMax, Inventor and Revit, SketchUp) Rendering Engines (Vray, Corona Renderer, Keyshot, Lumion and Unreal Engine) a bit of VFX abilities (Houdini, DRS) and web design using online tools like Figma.
