            My name is Safin rahman. I am a CSE graduate from SWFU. I graduated
            in December 2021. SWFU is a reputed
            university in Kunming, China. During my course, I had the opportunity
            to study with a coursework of various subjects which include Engineering
            subjects and modules. The modules included not only basics of the courses
            but also the advanced modules of the courses. I had the opportunity to harness
            my coding skills along with cultural skills for communication and easy lifestyle.
            In the year of 2017 I got myself to a job in Hazera design & development Ltd.
            Work as a Computer Operator in that company. My work was mainly focused on taking
            down Data, from everyday sales of the company. Primarily, I had to learn and get
            used to the work environment for better knowledge of the company procedures. After
            the sabbatical, I worked as full time, maintaining data and other resources including
            having some market research. After having done that job, I was found to have excellent
            skills for research and data based work. With skills that I harness, I believe I can
            bring outstanding outcomes in studies as well as my career life.
            Industrial design is an applied art that focuses on the process of developing a product 
            for manufacture. Industrial designers often focus on many aspects of a future product, 
            including how it functions, what it looks like and what manufacturing processes it requires. 
            The process of industrial design is often collaborative, and industrial designers may work 
            with other professionals such as graphic designers, artists, marketers and manufacturers. 
            The end goal of this process is to create a product that responds to customer needs. 
            I'm excited to find my first project position
            for the coming year on Design Engineering. I have several original lesson plans I created
            during my learnig period that I look forward to implementing in my own
            project. It would be a joy for me to make my project
            which will sparked my love of learning.
