# Introduction

In the process of vaporizing materials, a laser creates a cut edge, which is how laser cutting works. A high-power laser's output is typically directed through optics to produce laser cutting. To direct the material or laser beam produced, laser optics and CNC (computer numerical control) are used. Using a motion control system, a commercial laser for cutting materials cuts onto the material by following a CNC. When a focused laser beam is pointed at a substance, it either melts, burns, vaporizes, or is blown away by a jet of gas, leaving an edge with a high-quality surface finish.

# How does it work
The laser beam is a column of light that has a single wavelength or color and a very high intensity. The diameter of the beam as it passes through the machine's beam path from the laser resonator is typically just around 3/4 of an inch. In the laser cutting head, either a curved mirror or a customized lens can be used to focus the laser beam. The beam needs to be accurately focused in order for the focus spot to have an exact circular form, consistent energy density, and to be centered in the nozzle.
The intense heat density is achieved by narrowing the broad beam to a single pinpoint.

# Safety Instruction
[Reference](https://www.nexmaker.com/doc/6laser_cutter/Safety.html)<br>
Most types of lasers operating in the visible and near infrared regions are sufficiently intense as to represent a hazard to the eye. Although damage may be caused to all parts of the eyes, the most vulnerable part is the retina, on which the beam may be focussed by the eye lens resulting in the destruction of tissues and the creation of permanent blind spots. High power lasers can also damage the skin. Only trained peaple can operate the machine, and we must close the enclosure before run the machine.

# Available Materials
* Paper
* Acrylic
* Wood or Cardboard

# Preparing the machine
Make sure to check all connections, this includes the power socket for the laser cutter, the smoke exhaust fan which should be open and running, the water tank, and the pump.

# Running the machine
Turn on the laser cutter. place the material flat on the platform. place a block between the nozzle and material. rise platform to min the gap.
