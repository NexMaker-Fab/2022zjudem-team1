# FUSION 360


Fusion 360 is a cloud-based 3D modeling, CAD, CAM, CAE, and PCB software platform for professional product design and manufacturing.
> Fusion 360 is the first and only integrated cloud CAD, CAM, CAE, and PCB product development solution for product designers, mechanical engineers, electronics engineers, and machinists. It allows you to connect your entire design to manufacture product development process to deliver high-quality products to market faster and positively impact your bottom line. It includes generative design, 2.5, 3, 4, & 5-axis machining, and advanced simulation and is available on PC and Mac.
Fusion 360 is based on another product of Autodesk,  the Inventor, a user-friendly design and simulation program that also houses tools for creating models and assemblies. Then the company released an even more successful and modern piece of software — Fusion 360, which is mainly cloud-based and capable of enabling group access to projects and cloud storage. It was an innovative solution, and the process of creating the interface was mainly inspired by users feedback, while some of the options and add-ons were integrated after software engineers and active users joined efforts. One of the key features of Fusion 360 is combining all of the stages of creating 3D parts and designs, from a prototype to a finished product, in a single sustainable workflow.   

Key features include the program not only supporting cloud storage but also a cloud render, which can be accessed by users with slow computers for “credits” — a kind of internal software currency earned by active use of the program.
As already described above, group access is something that no software has ever offered. Publicly shared access to file settings, a separate file storage folder, file versions are just a part of what Fusion 360 has to offer to streamline project management.
Another feature of Fusion 360, no longer unique, is scripting. But these are not just the usual scripts we’re used to working with in Solidworks or Inventor, which utilize the model’s parametricity, assemblies and their parts as well as animation parameters. Autodesk introduced a dedicated section on their website, where anyone can download a template that will help speed up the design workflow.
Another noteworthy feature is that the program does not consume much computer resources and works using an online connection. The installation file is relatively small and takes up little hard drive memory, compared to other Autodesk programs, while installation usually takes about five minutes.

At first, Fusion 360 got a lot of backlash for its cloud-based limitations, with some users refusing to switch from Inventor to Fusion, fearing potential file leaks and that the program would not function offline. This issue is solved by engaging offline mode, when all changes and the file itself are saved on your local computer while the software continues to function with no Internet connection.

# SOLIDWORKS
SOLIDWORKS is used by millions of designers and engineers at hundreds of thousands of companies. It’s one of the most popular design and engineering software on the market. Known for its range of features and high functionality, SOLIDWORKS is used across multiple professions and industries around the world.
<div class="loader"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/xXTxX7z/solidworks-social-12.jpg" alt="#" /></div>
SOLIDWORKS uses parametric design, which is why it’s such an effective tool for designers and engineers. This means that the designer can see how changes will affect its neighboring components, or even the overall solution. For example, if the size of a single component is increased, this would affect the joint or hole it’s attached to. This allows designers to spot and correct issues quickly and easily.
SOLIDWORKS Features Simple but sophisticated 3D CAD design Use templates and the CAD library for improved efficiency Automation and design reuse to speed up the process Cost estimation tools allow you to keep track in real-time Ensure potential risks are caught early with interference check Quickly produce 2D drawings for production Easily create animations and photorealistic renderings

Which Professions and Industries Benefit from SOLIDWORKS?
> Industries:
* Aerospace & Defense
* Consumer Packaged Goods
* Life Sciences
* Transport & Mobility
* Energy, Process, & Utilities

> Professions:

* Mechanical engineers
* Product engineers
* Designers
* Drafters
* Planners
* Artists & Graphical Illustrators
* Architects
* Electrical engineers
* Process & Piping engineers (P&ID)

> To prove familiarity with the software, for this part, the Units used were metric whereas the rest of the drawings were made using imperial.

### MODELLING PROCEDURE
Before creating a geometry model, we must have a global coordinate system in mind. In this case, the origin for the arm is picked for the first circle as shown. Double-click the Solidworks button to launch. From the Solidworks user interface click on new to start a new part.
![](https://i.ibb.co/xgnyXx0/cad1.png)
![alt text](https://i.ibb.co/1bFWhrm/cad1edited.png)
![](https://i.ibb.co/p1SG00C/step-2.png)
Select the Sketch toolbar from the user interface.
![](https://i.ibb.co/0CqbN9n/2.png)
Choose the Front plane as shown.
![](https://i.ibb.co/740M0rc/step5.png)
This leads you to the screen below with the origin shown in red.
![](https://i.ibb.co/q1HJy3S/step7.png)
Draw the first circle of any radius about the origin. 
![](https://i.ibb.co/ch1vJzW/step8.png)
The blue outline around the circle means that the circle has not been fully defined.
![](https://i.ibb.co/k68m2tS/step9.png)
Draw a second circle with a center any distance from the first. Fully define this distance with the smart dimension feature. Move the cursor around the X-axis until an Inference Line appears. Click to define the center, move away, and click again to define an arbitrary diameter. Click the two center points one after another and then move the mouse upward and click again to create this horizontal dimension; type 1.375 (in).
![](https://i.ibb.co/StFBhHw/step10.png)
Use the smart dimension feature to fully define the first circle diameter.
![](https://i.ibb.co/7STcjN6/step11.png)
Do the same for the second circle.
![](https://i.ibb.co/1QB0kkk/step12.png)
Add a third circle with a fixed distance from the first circle.
![](https://i.ibb.co/bKfSGF1/step13.png)
And fully define the distance using smart dimension. 
![](https://i.ibb.co/YBWK2V7/step14.png)
![](https://i.ibb.co/smR73qb/step15.png)
Use Circle command to draw three circles which are concentric with the first three circles respectively.
![](https://i.ibb.co/7GL2CV0/step16.png)
Click the upper quarter-point of the first circle and click the upper quarter-point of the second circle. Double-click to end the line drawing.
And also draw two tangent lines to the third circle. Note that, to draw the tangent lines, you click  a circle NEAR quarter-points (rather than AT quarter-points). For these two tangent lines, the tangent points are not at quarter-points. 
![](https://i.ibb.co/4jFBw4x/step17.png)
Press ESC to dismiss the Line command. Select Trim Entities from the Context Menu. In the Property Box, select Trim to closest.
![](https://i.ibb.co/p2wDN5D/step18.png)
Press ESC to dismiss Smart Dimension. Select Sketch Fillet from the Context Menu. And then select the sharp corner from the trim
![](https://i.ibb.co/G9Cj91p/step19.png)
Exit the sketch function.
![](https://i.ibb.co/Kh7qDzj/step20.png)
Select the sketch and choose the extrude function from the user interface.
![](https://i.ibb.co/Kh7qDzj/step20.png)
![](https://i.ibb.co/kqB7HNf/step21.png)
An additional feature for the extrude function appears with unspecified thickness.
![](https://i.ibb.co/DVd5R7n/step22.png)
Enter the thickness size to complete the part
![](https://i.ibb.co/DQj4pLr/step23.png)

The same or similar procedure is used to complete the rest of the parts for the assembly.
