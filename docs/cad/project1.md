All your works can be seen by your team members, provided you don't forget to update.  
# 2.MODELING
## What to model?
>Our group plans to present a musical toy with wooden structure at the end of the design engineering course, which needs a wooden locomotive model, so we directly take a small train as an example at this stage.  
>+ #### First, before the modeling, we did several research about train toys on the markets.

>+ #### Second, we decide the approximate size of the little train through group discussing. 
>+ #### Third, it's time make it by your own hands!   
## How to model?
>Due to the requirements for assembly and animation display of the homework after class, we have conducted some targeted supplementary learning on Fusion 360 through rich online tutorial resources.
>### Preparation
>>+ #### Create a new folder for your team, and renamed it as your team name proudly(btw. we are team Peopl3 drag pe2son).
>>+ #### New a drawing for you part.
>>+ #### Save it, and name it, and you get it.  
>### JUST DO IT!!!
>>Well, it's really disappointing that 3dsMax and other modeling softwares are not allowed in this class. Learning a new one in such a short time is a definitely a challenge for us.  
>>+ #### A Little MEME be like↓↓  
>>\- I want to use Fusion 360 for modeling.    
>>\- Just do it.  
>>\- But, I don't know how to use Fusion 360 for modeling.  
>>\- Just, do , ittttttttttttttttttt!!!  
>>(Well, then, long time has past...)  
>>(Congratulations for the warriors, at least, they finally succeeded.)  
>### TIPS
>>In the process of learning Fusion 360, we found and mastered some tips for using the software.  
>>+ #### 1.Center: Double click the mouse wheel to quickly center your part to the center of the canvas.  
>>+ #### 2.Forward/backward: Press and hold the right key to scan left/right.
>>+ #### 3.Search: Press "S" and you can search for the function you want by name. 
>>+ #### 4.Select the surface occluded by the solid: Long press the left mouse button on the solid.  
>>+ #### 5.Switch color: Press "Shift" and "N" at the same time to quickly switch color discrimination between material color.   
## Our model
>Here we got our cutey little train.  
Maybe there are a few of flaws, just... you know, forgive me :)

# 3.ASSEMBLY PARTS
>The most important part is the rotating shaft and wheels that make sure the little train runs properly. Luckily, we did it!  
>+ #### Before you enter this part, you should make sure that your creation is ***parts***, not ***entities***!!!  
>+ #### Then switch your canvas from ***Design*** to ***Assembly***.  
>+ #### Then... it's hard to describe the painful process... If Jesus gives me a chance, I choose to forget it, definitely. 
 
# 4.RESULT
We made a simple animation for the little train!
