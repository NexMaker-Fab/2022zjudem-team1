# User Research
Target Users: Health-conscious individuals, people with allergies or respiratory issues, and those interested in home decor and technology.

# Innovation
Features:

* Monitors indoor air quality and displays readings on a small LCD screen
* An RGB matrix changes the colors based on the air quality readings (e.g. green for good air quality, yellow for moderate, red for poor) the color from the LEDs is spread inside the lamp creating an atmospheric lighting
* Creates a visual-appealing and relaxing light effect, using a silent fan for the air quality components, which also produces a calming sound
* Can be used as a table lamp with adjustable brightness and color options (future versions)
* Compact and portable design, perfect for use in a bedroom or office space (future versions)
* Can connect to a smartphone app for real-time air quality updates and tracking (future versions)

Benefits:

* Provides a fun and interactive way to monitor indoor air quality
* Helps users identify and address sources of indoor air pollution
* Enhances the aesthetic of a room with its sleek design and color-changing lights
* Reduces stress at work or helps to sleep at night.
* Promotes better indoor air quality and overall health and well-being

<br>The market for indoor air quality monitoring products is growing, driven by increasing awareness of the negative health impacts of poor indoor air quality. According to a report by Allied Market Research, the global indoor air quality monitoring market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11.3% from 2020 to 2027.
<br>
<br>Kazegami has a unique selling proposition (USP) in its combination of air quality monitoring and decorative table lamp functions. This combined functionality sets it apart from other, more basic air quality monitors, and appeals to consumers who are looking for both practical and aesthetic solutions for their indoor air quality needs.
<br>
<br>In terms of competition, Kazegami will face competition from established players in the indoor air quality monitoring market, such as Awair and Foobot. However, Kazegami's focus on design and style may give it an edge over more utilitarian-looking products.

# Key Technology
?>The PM2.5 air sensor is a device that measures the concentration of fine particulate matter (PM) in the air with a diameter of 2.5 micrometers or less. These small particles can be harmful to human health if inhaled, as they can penetrate deep into the lungs and even into the bloodstream. The PM2.5 air sensor works by using a laser to detect the number of particles in a given volume of air and converting this data into a concentration measurement. It is commonly used in air quality monitoring systems to track pollution levels and inform decisions related to public health and safety.
